# Pintar
Small rendering engine with Eigen linear algebra data structures on top of OpenGL. Made for prototyping interactive graphics solutions. It currently contains a basic hierarchical object structure, camera and arcball camera definitions, mesh loading and (slow) traversal, and rigid body simulation. The main program is a demo of the rigid body simulator where you can draw the force you want to apply to the model.

##Compilation
$sh compile.sh

##Execution
./bin/main models/cube.obj
